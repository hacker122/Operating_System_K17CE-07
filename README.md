According to the question provided,
IndianRail has decided to improve its efficiency by automating not just its trains but also its passengers.
Each passenger and each train are controlled by a thread. 
We have to  write a synchronization functions that will guarantee orderly loading of trains.

According to the question 
Petersonâ€™s Algorithm((Mutex algorithm)) is used in this code along with the concept of deadlock avoidance
Mutex algorithm  allows two or more processes to share a single-use resource without conflict, using only shared memory for communication.
I am using  concept of semaphore in this code for purpose instead of mutex Algorithm.
